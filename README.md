The accreditation was successfully granted to the MSc in Smart Cities and Analytics programme, applicable from the academic year 2021-2022. However, commencing in September 2022 CASAâ€™s previous MSc and MRes degrees in Smart Cities and Urban Analytics and Spatial Data Science and Visualisation were combined into a single programme entitled Urban Spatial Science with pathways in term 2 for thematic specialisation. The pathways include (1) Smart Cities and Urban Policy, (2) Modelling and Simulation, and (3) Visualisation. The documents present an overview of the programme and modules along with alignment to the RGS accreditation criteria, programme standards monitoring, student professional practical opportunities and a programme level assessment matrix.
